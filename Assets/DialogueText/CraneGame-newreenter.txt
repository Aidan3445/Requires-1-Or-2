Hello I'll keep this brief.
wait you have already been here.
Guess you aren't really good at this.
that or you just love being a crane.
....
you are a weird human.
anyways use the left joystick to move up,down,left,right.
use the right joystick to go forwards and backwards.
pick up objects and put them in which bin you think they should go.
good luck.
