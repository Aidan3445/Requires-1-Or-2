I love working in this lab. We make such innovative and cool tech.
One time we developed this intricate device to lightly crisp "bread"
I've never tried bread before ... I actually never eaten anything ... ever
Anyways, we have some of our latest tech here. Let me know what you think of them.
You can use the grip button to pick them up.
Mmmmmm ... bread.
