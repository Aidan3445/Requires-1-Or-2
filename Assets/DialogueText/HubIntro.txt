Kyle
Beep boop bop?
Sorry, you probably don't understand that, human.
My name is Kyle.
We actually are all Kyle.
Welcome to the Research Lab of Insanity.
We take willing human subjects like yourself and put you through some, uh, tests.
Don't worry, you already signed all the liability forms.
Take a look around! To move around, use the left controller trigger to teleport.
Not all of our tests allow you to teleport like this but feel free to explore our lab here.
You can try out some of our tech before starting a test by grabbing with the right grip button.
But don't worry, we will politely watch and take notes on your performance. No judgement. For real.
Behind me are the three tests we have for you today.
Simply teleport into the scene to get started.
Happy Experimenting!
