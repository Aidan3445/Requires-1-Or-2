Memory Kyle
Hello there!
I've remembered every event that's occurred since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC.
But you humans always seem to have memory leak issues.
Like what did you even have for dinner last night?
Anyways, we have an experiment to test your memory.
You must remember the matching cells behind you.
To select a cell, throw an axe at it.
Pick up an axe using the grip button. Try it now.
When throwing, release the grip button. Give it a throw.
We will conduct the experiment in a moment! Ready? Or did you forget how to play already?
Go go go!
