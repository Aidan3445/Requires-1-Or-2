Memory Kyle
Hello again!
Remember me? You were here not too long ago.
Forget the rules already? Here's a refresher.
You must remember the matching cells behind you.
To select a cell, throw an axe at it.
Pick up an axe using the grip button.
When throwing, release the grip button.
Ready? Or did you forget how to play already?
Go go go!
