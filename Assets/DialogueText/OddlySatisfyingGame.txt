Hiya!
You humans seem to be obsessed with being satisfied...
even...
Oddly Satisfied? 
What's that about?
So we built an experiment for you about just that!
Targets will move towards you and you have to grab the right object and fit it through the hole.
Use the trigger on either controller to jump to the other play-point.
Press A or X to reset the objects if they fall out of reach.
Oh, one more thing.
You humans love bonus points right? The sound of 'extra credit' really gets you going huh?
Well keep your eyes peeled for the different colored targets.
Green will give you 300 points, Yellow 200, and Red 100!
Easy enough right? In a moment, you'll turn around and the game will begin.
Good luck!
