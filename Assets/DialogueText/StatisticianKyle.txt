Did you know that 97% of humans that did the Memory Game had a perfect score?
Or was it 79%?
Wait ... no it was 9%. Gah I should really remember remember these stats.
Take a look at the screen with me. It shows your status on each of the tests.
Maybe you can do a better job of remembering all this. I can remember with 82% certainty.
