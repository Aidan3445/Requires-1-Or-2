## Game Description

In a future where robots named Kyle rule the world, our AI overlords are obsessed with finding the depth of the human psyche but also get a kick out of driving us insane. In "Requires One Or Two," you find yourself in a research lab full of twisted games designed by the Robots to bring you to your breaking point. Can you outsmart the Kyle robots, or will you succumb to the madness and become just another statistic in their diabolical experiments?

#### Note
This project was the final project for CS 5097 - Mixed Reality. In development, we intended for there to be a two-player mode (hence the title play on '[It Takes 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426210/It_Takes_Two/)') where players would have the opportunity to choose to work together or against each other. We unfortunately were not able to add this to the game before the course was over.

## Game Mechanics

Requires One Or Two features a range of game mechanics to keep players engaged:

**Physical Controls:**
- Progress dialogue (any scene)
- Navigation (hub)
- Start scene (hub)
- Return to hub (any test)
- Switch spot (oddly satisfying)
- Grab object (any scene)
- Movement (crane game)

**Core Game Mechanics:**
- Talk with a Kyle (hub)
- Rotation matching (oddly satisfying)
- Point values (oddly satisfying)
- Axe tip sticking (memory game)
- Object highlighting (crane game)
